<h1>Breast-cancer-project</h1> </br>
<h2>Overview </h2> </br>
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on various medical features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about breast cancer patients, including tumor characteristics and other relevant medical data.</br>

<h2> Dataset </h2> </br>
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset includes 569 instances and 30 features.</br>

<h2> Features </h2> </br>
The dataset includes the following features:</br>

-Radius</br>

-Texture</br>

-Perimeter</br>

-Area</br>

-Smoothness</br>

-Compactness</br>

-Concavity</br>

-Concave points</br>

-Symmetry</br>

-Fractal dimension</br>

<h2> Model</h2> </br>
The machine learning model used in this project is a Random Forest classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier and Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.</br>

Installation To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:</br>

-numpy</br>

-pandas</br>

-scikit-learn</br>

-matplotlib</br>

Results</br>
<h2> The model achieves an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are provided in the results section of the project.</h2> <br>
